# GravityBox
A soothing gravitational canvas that lets you create beautiful, Minecraft-style orbital systems in the browser.

# Stars

# Particles
Particles are your paint

# Brush Radius and Density
Changing around the brush radius and density makes for some incredible gravitational art, all while guaranteeing the efficiency of a constant number of system particles.

# Eccentricity
This number determines the speed at which particles are injected into orbit.


### Other notes

#### Fixed Path vs Orbits

If multiple stars, the stars are fixed and they follow a predetermined opath
If one star and zero or more planets, the singular star is movable

So we can add planets at will.
