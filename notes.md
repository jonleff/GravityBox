# Fixed Path vs Orbits

If multiple stars, the stars are fixed and they follow a predetermined opath
If one star and zero or more planets, the singular star is movable

So we can add planets at will.


# Old Notes

// Sample simulation setup code
/*

// Free particles make up clouds and have a mass of 1. 
// They are free to move around space under the gravity of nearby stars and do not collide with one another. 
// Free particles that collide with stars are absorbed and disappear from the system

// Stars have a variable mass and radius, and attract free particles
// Stars can be fixed (meaning they do not move) or free (meaning they can move around under the gravitational influence of other stars)
// Below is an example of how you can add a star to the system:

// have the orbitTarget and cameraTarget be dynamically updated to follow a star, system CoM, etc.

// what happens when stars collide?

// need to fix resolution and sizing and make everything work perfectly

// DRAG AND DROP AND AIM CLOUDS AND STARS AND REALLY HAVE A FUN DYANMIC SYSTEM THAT CAN BE PLAYED WITH
// click + sign to add a star or cloud to the system, see it in grey until its placed, click and drag to aim and see trajectory real time, release to launch!
// have the ability to launch planets!

// first thing to get this working with is ability to drag stars and scene and have physics update accordingly
// click on a star to open a menu for its options, like mass and everything

// we are going to the moon here!

// how about orbiting stars?
